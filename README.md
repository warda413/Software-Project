🔬 BioLite Studio
A Simple Python-Based GUI for DNA Sequence Analysis and Visualization

BioLite Studio is a lightweight, user-friendly desktop tool developed in Python using Tkinter. It enables students, educators, and researchers in bioinformatics to perform essential DNA sequence analysis through a graphical interface — no coding required.

🚀 Key Features
GC Content Analysis: Calculate and visualize GC% across full sequences or sliding windows.

FASTA Viewer: View DNA sequences with line numbers, base counts, and sequence stats.

Multi-sequence Support: Analyze multiple sequences from a single FASTA file, each with individual stats.

Mutation Simulator: Apply user-defined point mutations and preview effects.

Protein Translation & Comparison: Translate original and mutated sequences with highlighted amino acid differences.

Visualization Tools:

Pie charts for nucleotide composition

Line/bar graphs for GC content

Protein comparison highlighting mutation impacts

Data Export: Save results to TXT, CSV, or Excel formats.

Project Save/Load: Reload entire analysis sessions for continuity.
